    The volatility, in this example, is simply a price change compared to the previous cycle regardless of its
    direction, e.g. if price changes -3% (or 3%), the volatility is 3%.
    To update our pure market making spreads, we're gonna smooth out the volatility by averaging it over a short period
    (short_period), and we need a benchmark to compare its value against. In this example the benchmark is a median
    long period price volatility (you can also use a fixed number, e.g. 3% - if you expect this to be the norm for your
    market).
